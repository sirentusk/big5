		<p id="bold">86% Volatility (the tendency to become irritable and upset when things go wrong) [High]</p>
		<p id="italic">The mean percentile for women in a general population is 57.5. For men it is 42.5.</p>

		<p>Can be stirred up and upset and, once angry or irritated, take a longer than average time to calm down.</p>
		<p>Can be argumentative and lose their composure.</p>
		<p>Can be provocative in a dispute.</p>
		<p id="bold">Opinion</p>
		<p id="italic">High Volatility + Low Politeness</p>
		<p id="italic">Connects up to the low politeness to create a sort of debator personality where I tend to enjoy an intellectual debate - often sparked by an observed annoyance or frustration in conversation. I like to "talk deep" and get volatile when presented with a strongly held but shallow or regurgitated, rather than well understood, opinions. Which leads me to then utilise my disagreeableness to ask blunt questions, usually uncommon blunt questions due to the high openness.</p>
		<p id="italic">High Volatility + High Openness</p>
		<p>Some types of artists are correlated to high neuroticism. I believe volatility is associated with my high openness, ie, it correlates to a heightened desire for awe. As my serotonin peaks, I look for something "otherworldly" as I feel out-of-the-normal when in a state of high anger, but my IQ remains intact, so I start "searching" whilst in an "anger" state. I would say my "go to" emotion is frustration and I tend to transmute/channel the released serotonin into creative outlets. It is like "pumping yourself up" before a fight, sometimes the volatility is uncorrelated to environmental stimuli accurately (the fight is hypothetically proposed rather than actually occuring), as documented with <a href="https://sci-hub.se/10.1001/archpsyc.1984.01790150095013">monkeys</a, for more information read my article about serotonin here, and so my brain has to then find an outlet for the hypothetical as its performed its practiced duty of providing the possibly needed chemicals to increase my aggression.</p>
		<p id="italic">High Volatility + High Industriousness</p>
		<p id="italic">Get internally angry but not likely to express it as much externally, see <a href="https://sci-hub.se/10.1016/j.jad.2006.05.016">study</a>. I tend to sometimes let off a scathing remark but my volatility is generally internalised where I go find a more useful outlet for the aggression.</p>
		<p id="italic">Most things that annoy people do not seem to affect me at all. I have a flat emotional response to a lot of things, I just don't notice a lot of things, give the world the benefit of the doubt. But due to the industriousness (<a href="https://hexaco.sirenwatcher.dev/">perfectionism</a> in HEXACO), inefficiency and badly run businesses seem to spark my volatility heavily. It is a particular kind of volatility. A lack of a company's innovativeness (openness), false authority (politeness) which a personality is backed (true authority I find admirable, like an expert in a field), lack of basic oversight in care for others (compassion) (this is complex, but it is not about care, its about, making sure things are moving in the right direction through being able to track 'known variables' if people are put into a state of unrest they become less easy to calculate and therefore causes issues (industriousness/disagreeableness - interest in things and the work put into them), lack of allowance of openness concepts, etc.</p>

		<h2><a id="testing">Testing</a></h2>
			<p>A <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/personality/personality-tests" target="_blank">Big 5 Personality Test</a>, is a core psychology test designed to help a person understand fundamentally what kind of profession is best for them based on their inherent personality. It was developed in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits" target="_blank">1980s</a>.</p>
			<p>I undertook a test designed by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q" target="_blank">Jordan Peterson</a>, a Canadian clinical psychologist. He was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Peterson" target="_blank">professor</a> at Harvard University and the University of Toronto. He has <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jordan-Peterson-9" target="_blank">authored</a> or co-authored more than a hundred academic papers and has been cited over ten thousand times. If you would like to take the test I took to compare yourself, the test is available <a href="https://www.understandmyself.com/personality-assessment" target="_blank">here</a> on his website for a low fee.</p>
			<p>This psychological profile is split into <b>5 areas</b>, which have <b>2 sections</b> each. A <b>higher</b> percentage means the default trait exhibits more in the personality, a <b>lower</b> percentage means the person uses this feature less in their psyche. The descriptions are split into Exceptionally High, Very High, Moderately High, High, Average, Low, Moderately Low, Very Low, and Exceptionally Low for how each trait enacts in a person.</p>
			<p>The test also gives comparisons to all other test takers for the average. Ie, average % for women, average % for men, so you can see how different you are from the general population of test takers.</p>
			<p>A more basic version of the test is available, after the first personality test, on Jonathan Haidt's <a href="https://yourmorals.org/" target="_blank">website</a> also. This test shows the basic 5 areas but does not break it down into the 10 which I personally feel is more useful though this one is free.</p>
			<p>In the below image, this gives a further breakdown into the subdomains of the big 10. 1.0 = 100% correlation, 0.8 + 80% correlative, etc.</p>
