		<h2><a id="testing">Testing</a></h2>
			<p>A <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/personality/personality-tests" target="_blank">Big 5 Personality Test</a>, is a core psychology test designed to help a person understand fundamentally what kind of profession is best for them based on their inherent personality. It was developed in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits" target="_blank">1980s</a>.</p>
			<p>I undertook a test designed by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q" target="_blank">Jordan Peterson</a>, a Canadian clinical psychologist. He was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Peterson" target="_blank">professor</a> at Harvard University and the University of Toronto. He has <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jordan-Peterson-9" target="_blank">authored</a> or co-authored more than a hundred academic papers and has been cited over ten thousand times. If you would like to take the test I took to compare yourself, the test is available <a href="https://www.understandmyself.com/personality-assessment" target="_blank">here</a> on his website for a low fee.</p>
			<p>This psychological profile is split into <b>5 areas</b>, which have <b>2 sections</b> each. A <b>higher</b> percentage means the default trait exhibits more in the personality, a <b>lower</b> percentage means the person uses this feature less in their psyche. The descriptions are split into Exceptionally High, Very High, Moderately High, High, Average, Low, Moderately Low, Very Low, and Exceptionally Low for how each trait enacts in a person.</p>
			<p>The test also gives comparisons to all other test takers for the average. Ie, average % for women, average % for men, so you can see how different you are from the general population of test takers.</p>
			<p>A more basic version of the test is available, after the first personality test, on Jonathan Haidt's <a href="https://yourmorals.org/" target="_blank">website</a> also. This test shows the basic 5 areas but does not break it down into the 10 which I personally feel is more useful though this one is free.</p>
			<p>In the below image, this gives a further breakdown into the subdomains of the big 10. 1.0 = 100% correlation, 0.8 + 80% correlative, etc.</p>
